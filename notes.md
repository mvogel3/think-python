# Chapter Summaries/Take Aways

Chapter 3: explains the purpose of functions and how arguments are passed through them. answered my questions surrounding the purpose of parameters and how they can have different names in different places. touches on encapsulation e.g., a variable declared inside of a function does not exist outside of it. good practice problems.

Chapter 4: introduces loops and methods. also gives a mathematical but clear example of how functions work together and build on each other. expands the notion of parameters and arguments in functions.
