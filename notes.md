# Research
* Python shell vs zsh shell
* look into the 4.12 exercises and try learning the math

# Chapter Summaries/Take Aways

**Chapter 3:** explains the purpose of functions and how arguments are passed through them. answered my questions surrounding the purpose of parameters and how they can have different names in different places. touches on encapsulation e.g., a variable declared inside of a function does not exist outside of it. good practice problems.
* empty parenthesis after a function name indicate that it does not take any arguments.
* the name of the variable we pas as an argument (lucy) has nothing to do with the name of the parameter (meg). it does not matter what the value is called back home (in the caller); here in print_twice, we call everybody meg.
* '_ _main_ _' is a special name for the topmost frame. when you create a variable outside of any function, it belongs to 'underscore underscore main underscore underscore'.
* each parameter refers to the same value in as its corresponding argument. so part1 has the same value as line1, part2 has the same value as line2, and 'meg' has the same value as 'cat'.

**Chapter 4:** introduces loops and methods. also gives a mathematical but clear example of how functions work together and build on each other. expands the notion of parameters and arguments in functions. getting the turtle library up and running refreshed my memory for using virtual environments and stack overflow.

**Chapter 5:** deals with conditionals and their terminology. 
* each condition is checked in order. if more than one condition is true, only the first branch runs.
* avoid nested conditionals when possible for the sake of readability.
